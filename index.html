                <p>
                At the end of high school, I didn’t know which major I wanted to pursue. 
                My parents didn’t have enough money to support me in another city, so I applied to a small federal university in my hometown.

                I had never had any contact with programming or the IT world before. 
                At the beginning, I struggled a lot, but I kept pushing myself to improve, understand more about technology, and never give up.

                Sometimes I feel like I’m behind, but as I like to say: 
                "Since I'm looking from behind, I know the way to go forward."

                Over time, it has been incredibly rewarding to realize what I’m capable of doing,
                especially in a field I once thought I would never understand. 
                I may not be exactly where I want to be yet, but I trust that one day I’ll look back and feel proud of how far I’ve come.

                <p>
                Today, I am focused on improving my development skills, building real-world projects, and learning new technologies, as well as strengthening soft skills such as communication, leadership, and empathy.
                I am looking for opportunities that can expose me to real-world challenges and help me grow as a developer.
                I believe that consistency beats intensity, and I am committed to becoming better every day, both technically and personally.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am also interested in understanding agile methodologies and how teams collaborate effectively. 
                In the future, I would like to take on more leadership responsibilities as I gain experience.
